###  Reflection (STAR)
S – Situation:
During the career development module, I completed a series of quiz questions related to career counselling, career development, and skill identification.

T – Task:
One of the tasks required me to distinguish between hard and soft skills and correctly identify an example of a hard skill from the provided options.

A – Action:
I reviewed the course material on skill types and used my understanding to identify that hard skills are teachable and measurable abilities, such as coding, typing, or using specific software. I then selected the correct answer accordingly.

R – Result:
I answered the question correctly and solidified my understanding of the difference between hard and soft skills. This knowledge will help me accurately present my capabilities in future CVs and interviews.
