###  Reflection (STAR)
S – Situation:
As part of the work readiness training, I was required to create a professional CV. This included learning about the correct structure, essential sections, and how to tailor content to effectively present my experience and skills to potential employers.

T – Task:
The objective was to build a CV that clearly communicates my qualifications, work experience, education, and relevant skills in a concise and impactful format suitable for job applications.

A – Action:
I completed a CV quiz to assess my understanding of key principles. Although I initially answered the question about the primary purpose of a CV incorrectly, I reviewed the learning material, reattempted the quiz, and achieved full correctness on the second try. I then used this knowledge to draft a CV, ensuring I included:

A clear professional summary

Chronological work experience (most recent first)

Focused education section with relevant dates and institutions

A tailored skills section matching industry needs

R – Result:
I successfully created a well-structured CV that highlights my strengths, qualifications, and readiness for the workplace. The process improved my understanding of how to present myself professionally on paper and prepared me for real-world job applications.
