###  Reflection (STAR)
S – Situation:
As part of the Skills and Interests module, I completed a comprehensive set of activities and quizzes that focused on understanding personal values, types of skills, interests, and their influence on career decisions.

T – Task:
The goal was to accurately identify and distinguish between values, hard skills, soft skills, and transferable skills, and understand how they align with potential career paths.

A – Action:
I engaged in multiple-choice assessments and reflection exercises. I correctly identified what values are, the nature of skills, and the meaning of interests. While I initially answered one question on transferable skills incorrectly, I reviewed the content again and successfully corrected it in a follow-up attempt, demonstrating my ability to learn from mistakes and reinforce my understanding.

R – Result:
I successfully completed the section with a 100% completion rate. I gained a clearer picture of how my interests (e.g., creative problem-solving, working with technology) and transferable skills (e.g., communication, teamwork) can guide my career choices. This reflection helped me recognize the importance of aligning career goals with core personal values for long-term satisfaction and success.
