###  Reflection (STAR)
S – Situation:
As part of the work readiness training, I completed a series of personality assessment quizzes designed to help identify my personality type and its alignment with potential career paths. These assessments included questions about realistic, artistic, conventional, and investigative personality traits.

T – Task:
The aim was to understand how personality influences career choices and to identify career paths that align with my natural preferences, strengths, and working style.

A – Action:
I engaged with multiple quiz attempts to improve my understanding. While I initially struggled with some questions—such as identifying the goal of personality-career matching or the characteristics of analytical thinkers—I reviewed my answers, reflected on the feedback, and corrected my mistakes in later attempts. I also examined the descriptions of different personality types (e.g., Realistic, Artistic, Conventional) and how they relate to specific careers.

R – Result:
Through this process, I became more aware of my dominant personality traits and how they can guide my career direction. I learned that I resonate most with [insert your personality type here, e.g., “Investigative” or “Conventional”], which suggests I thrive in environments that are [e.g., analytical, structured, or creative]. This insight will help me focus on career paths that are more personally fulfilling and aligned with my strengths.
